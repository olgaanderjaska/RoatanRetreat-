 <p>We were frequent guessts in Roatán for a few years. Roatán was our home away from home. After going back and forth, we decided to build a house there. It was so exciting for us but at the same time we were so scared to do such a big step espacially in a different country like Honduras. FYI: we do not speak Spanish eather. But we felt right to do it! So six months latter we built our gorgeous house in Roatán.</p>
 <br>
 <p>While we are not on the island our beautiful and cozy beach house is open for our guesses. Please, check out our beautiful house on VRBO link: <a href="https://www.vrbo.com/4489519ha" class="vrboLink">VRBO</a></p>
