  <h2>West Bay Beach</h2>

   <p>Our house is located 5 minutes from West Bay Beach. West Bay Beach is located on the western part of Roatan. The moment you set your eyes on this magnificent strip of sandy bliss, you will fall in love.</p>

   <p>West Bay is the picture-perfect Caribbean destination: white sand, clear, calm waters and full service restaurants. The variety of water activities include scuba diving, fishing charters, snorkeling and parasailing. Scuba diving and other outfitters leave directly from the beach so starting your water-based activities is easy and convenient. Water taxis connect West Bay Beach with West End Village (about ten minutes at a cost of about $3.00 USD) during daylight hours.</p>

   <p>The evenings in West Bay Beach are calm, relaxing and tranquil. Spectacular sunsets are common and because Roatan sits at 16 degrees latitude, sunset times vary by only about one hour throughout the year. There are several restaurants offering a variety of menus and experiences from casual to fine dining as well as lounges where you can find your favorite tropical drink or glass of wine. While West End Village, ten minutes away by car, is a hub of nightlife activity; West Bay Beach maintains a more family-friendly, slower-paced atmosphere.</p>

  <h2>Getting to West Bay Beach</h2>

  <p>West Bay Beach is approximately a 30 minute drive from the Roatan International Airport and Port of Roatan cruise ship terminal. Allow about 45 minutes to drive from the Carnival Cruise Ship Terminal (Mahogany Bay). Taxes are available. Transportation rental agencies are located at the airport as well as in the West Bay Mall.</p>

  <p>Water taxis connect West Bay Beach with West End Village (about ten minutes at a cost of about 50L ($2.60USD)) during daylight hours. Driving between the two communities takes approximately ten minutes. Taxis run constantly between the two towns.</p>
